Bugzilla
  - UNTRIAGED bugs with no needinfo :  https://mzl.la/2oaZl1K
  - UNTRIAGED bugs: https://mzl.la/2wAv7XZ
  - MALFORMED bugs (have necko-triaged set but no priority): https://mzl.la/2xXf2jc
  - P1 bugs  https://mzl.la/2he1C85
  - P2 bugs  https://mzl.la/2yaD1aO
  - P3 bugs  (backlog) https://mzl.la/2xcYzEL
  - P5 bugs (would take): https://mzl.la/2hdnQXy

Priorities
- P1 bugs (Blocker: get someone assigned ASAP: also EMAIL necko@moz whenever we have a new P1 bug)
- P2 bugs (Active--we intend to work on these now or this quarter)
- P3 bugs (backlog)
- There is no P4--don't use it
- P5 bugs (would take)

Principles
- P1 bugs MUST have a person assigned
- Non-necko people can be assigned to necko bugs just fine
- Bugs filed by wpt-bot should be marked triaged as P5. If something is needed there, someone can ni? one of us.
- If you’re filing a bug you’ll be working on (or as part of a project you’re working on, even if you won’t be working directly on it), please triage appropriately, so as to not overload whoever is on triage that week :-D

Mark as triaged
- Set [necko-triaged] in the whiteboard for bugs that have been triaged.
- Set Priority and Severity
